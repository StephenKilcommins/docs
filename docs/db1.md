## Navigation Menu

To get started, the first thing to do while familiarising yourself with the GECKO system is to explore the navigation menu that can help you navigate anywhere in the system and perform tasks. It's a scrollable menu which can be hidden using the hamburger menu as a 'toggle menu on/off' button.

‘Open Tasks’ - Number of tasks an individual user is working on 

Number of ‘Completed Tasks’

Allows you to create a New Project/fund

Manage fund Categories, Workflows and Users assigned to a project

Filter by project function - Filtering ‘Tasks by project’. i.e. Centralised / birds eye view     depending on your permission level and tasks that have to be completed for each stage of      the process / workflow based on the traffic light system.

We can use the drop-down menu to select a specific project to oversee the exact projects         that you are permissioned to work on. Presented as a pie chart we can see the number of          tasks that are **In Progress**, **Completed** and **Overdue**.
