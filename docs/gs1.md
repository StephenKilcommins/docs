import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

## Initial Setup

Only an admin or your manager can add you into the GECKO system, once added as a user you will receive an invite in your mail box. Simply click the link (please copy and paste it into your browser if clicking the link doesn't open a new tab for you) and confirm your password to be set up within the system. Once done, you will be able to login using the same email and password. If for some reason you're having trouble signing up with the link please request your admin to resend you another invite. In case you can't find the link in your inbox please go to your junk or spam box to see if it has been sent there instead.(check the image below)
